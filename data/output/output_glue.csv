1bf75hr,"Would Leverkusen winning the invincible treble be the greatest achievement in football history?","Despite it being in the Europa league, surely if Leverkusen win the bundesliga, pokal, and UEL without losing a single match (~60-75 games), it should be the greatest feat in football history. Nothing comes close. I don’t think any team would have gone that long unbeaten both home and away. They would set a new and pretty much unbreakable record of longest unbeaten streak in all comps home and away.   Surely if this happens, Alonso and all his players stay to kickstart a new era of dominance in Germany and compete in UCL long term? Could this be the start of Leverkusen becoming a European giant?

Very good crosser, passer and sometimes long distance shooter. He could work well as a RB, as he is a very offensive fullback, balancing nicely with a very defensive fullback, Mendy. Carvajal is also defensively solid, so he could play as a LB, on that occasion, especially on games when Real Madrid really need offensive fullbacks.

1bhdtkq,"Football has fallen off and I’m not a nostalgia merchant","Football has fallen off and I’m not a nostalgia merchant  Tactically the game has improved a lot , however in terms of entertainment and quality, I think football has decreased. Let me explain:  1. Flair and Individualism has decreased within football. Many coaches and top players have even said this is coached out of players nowadays due to too many instructions ( Lionel Scaloni is one who pointed this out). Wingers now aren’t as good as they were 10-20 years ago. We still have these players, but the amount and quality is dropping. Wingers now won’t dribble at their fullbacks as commonly as they would’ve before e.g Saka rarely ever attempts to beat his fullback, he’ll just simply pass back.  Best wingers itw in 2014: Messi, Ronaldo, Robben, Bale, Neymar, Ribery, Hazard, Sanchez etc (No order). compare that to the best wingers itw now. Same can be done for other positions.  2. Compare the best players itw today and the best players itw 10-20 years ago. Same with the best teams itw today and the best teams itw 10-20 years ago. There’s a decrease in quality within both.   3. Style of play within most teams is robotic. Players don’t shoot from distance nearly as much nowadays. Dribbling is even decreasing. Many teams just pass and pass and pass, it is incredibly boring. The prem nowadays is more boring to watch. E.g. watch the pl 2006 December goals of the month. Nowadays we will see one or two of those in a month if we’re lucky.  4. Leagues except for the prem have all fallen off (La Liga being a main one) Quality was more split throughout the top 5 leagues 10-20 years ago.  There’s more of course, in some ways football has improved, but I believe football as a sport isn’t an entertaining to the average fan as before. Many top pros and coaches and veteran football fans have pointed this out so it can’t just be me. Many scream nostalgia, but I don’t think that’s the case.

1bccy7c,"UCL Round of 16 last four games predictions:","* Barcelona 1-0 Napoli (Gundogan)  Both teams are pretty bad this season, but I still think Barcelona can grind a 1-0 or 2-1 result at home, maybe after extra time? Napoli barely had any shots in the 1st leg, so away I don't really expect them to score more than once.  * Arsenal 3-0 Porto (Saka x2, Gabriel)  Arsenal are a completely different team at home in the UCL, we saw it in the group stages. I know people will say that Porto are more experienced, but Arsenal simply are better on every aspect, they'll go through easily if they play like most of the time this season. Porto are 3rd on their league, they don't really have their best season, despite what happened in the 1st leg.   * Dortmund 2-1 PSV (Can, Fullkrug // Bakayoko)  PSV didn't do much in the home game, but they have scored 80 goals in 25 league games, I could totally see them scoring at least once. Dortmund have a good squad, but they're unpredictable. They've topped the ""group of death"", but we've also seen them suffering heavy defeats, like the 0-4 from Bayern. I still back them to make it to the quarter-finals.  * Atletico Madrid 0-2 Inter (Calhanoglu, Dimarco)  2-3 years ago everyone would call me crazy with this prediction. But right now, Inter are a top 3 team in the world in terms of form and they possess some really good players. Not to mention they were in the final last season. They're winning everyone this season, they don't care about home and away. Meanwhile Atletico are out of any other competition and recently received some humiliating defeats by Cadiz and Athetic Club. I know they're yet to lose at home in La Liga, but their best player (Griezmann) will either be out with injury, or will be forced to return asap for this game, none of this scenarios sound ideal. I think they'll attack for most of the game, to turn it around, but Inter will not concede and then hit on the counter.",44,54,Icy-Designer7103,"2024-03-11 20:11:10","https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1bccy7c/ucl_round_of_16_last_four_games_predictions/",0.86,False,False,False,False,98.0,37.839999999999996

1bh9qve,"Remove the ‘clear and obvious’ in VAR checks.","I’m sick and tired of VAR. The refereeing in West Ham vs Aston Villa was an absolute joke. 5 minutes for a VAR check? Why do they have these ‘clear and obvious’ criteria? Remove it and just make it so it can correct any mistake. I just want VAR to correct mistakes. Not to only correct bad mistakes and let the wrong decisions stand because ‘it’s not a clear and obvious mistake.’ Just change the damn ruling. They change it every few months anyways, just remove it and it makes the whole thing so much simpler. And none of this crap about it making the ref's jobs harder because it doesn’t, it makes it easier because they get to correct their mistakes instead of looking and seeing if it was that bad to correct or not. If you make a mistake, use VAR to correct it. End of.  EDIT - I never said I wanted an increase in VAR or any of the things half of you are saying. Just make VAR simple by removing these stupid criteria. I want less stoppage for VAR checks and more correct decisions made quickly.",41,49,Smart_But123581321,"2024-03-17 21:50:16","https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1bh9qve/remove_the_clear_and_obvious_in_var_checks/",0.73,False,False,False,False,90.0,29.93
